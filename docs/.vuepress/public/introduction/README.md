# Introduction

L5Modular allows you to organize your Laravel project in a modular manner.  
You can simply drop or generate modules with their own controllers, models, views, routes, etc. into the `app/Modules` folder and go on working with them.  
It is a highly customizable package and includes a lot of `artisan make` commands to make your life easier.
